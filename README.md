# Zermelo Notifier
Schedule android app for the Zermelo API, meant to push notifications when a change in schedule occurs.
[I used this API](https://zermelo.atlassian.net/wiki/display/DEV/Introduction)

## Compatibility
You need android version 16 or above to be able to run this application.

## Why did I make this app?
I was dissatisfied with the current application that Zermelo provides. It was slow and did not notify me when a lesson changed.

## What is the current state of the app?
It currently is able to show your schedule and notify you when anything changes. Still some major bugs though.
